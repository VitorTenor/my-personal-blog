  "resume": "I am a technology enthusiast who started exploring the world of programming at around 15 years old. Currently, I hold a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering and work as a developer at a technology and software development company. My journey includes a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, and I have previous experience in infrastructure. In my daily work, I build robust applications using technologies like Java with Spring Boot. I always prioritize Test-Driven Development (TDD) and SOLID principles to maintain code quality. In my spare time, I am driven by curiosity and enjoy exploring new technologies and developing applications using functional programming principles in Golang, such as APIs and processors. I work with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, as well as RabbitMQ for queue management. My passion for solving problems with code motivates me to be in constant learning mode.",
